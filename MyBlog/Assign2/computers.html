	  <h1> Computers </h1>
	  <p>
		  	I started my interest with computers at a very young age. My dad had a very close friend who worked with computers and
		  managed to get us the top of the line computer at the time which happened to be running windows 98 and loaded with the 
		  best games for its time. Games like:
		  <ul>
			  <li><a href = "../Images/roadrash.jpeg">Road Rash</a></li>
			  <li><a href = "../Images/LongBow.jpg">Jane's LongBow</a></li>
			  <li><a href = "../Images/subs.jpg">Jane's Submarines</a></li>
			  <li><a href = "../Images/b&b.jpg">Bevis and Butthead Golf</a></li>
		  </ul>
	  </p>

		  	Later on I went on a trip to Serbia for the summer where a relative introduced me to World of Warcraft. After I came home 
		  and started high school me and my cousin were watching tv when a World of Warcraft commercial came on. This is where me and my
		  cousin both thought it would be fun to try. We were hooked. We spent the rest of our high school free time and weekends hanging 
		  out together in a virtual world. I started on a very basic Compaq laptop with a 60GB hard drive and running windows Vista. Half 
		  way through high school I was gifted a Macbook Pro that after 7 years holds a charge for 2 hours and hasn't slowed down at all.

		  	Well even though the Macbook Pro was holding up well I started looking into better computer components and starting a general 
		  interest in making my own computer. This idea was put off for 4 years until I had enough money saved up to afford the components
		  I wanted. Well luckily in those 4 years better components had come out. Below is a table of components that make up my computer.
