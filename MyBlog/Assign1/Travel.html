	  <h1> Travel </h1>
	  <blockquote>
		  	Travelling is an idea that I have always enjoyed, but now that I can make money during the summer breaks I have taken it
		 upon myself to explore new places. When I was younger my mom and dad would send me and my brother to Serbia over the summer
		 to visit family. From Serbia we would go to Montenegro or Croatia to swim in the Adriatic sea. When I started paying for my 
		 own trips I went with my girlfriend to Mexico. This was a fantastic trip. However, we didn't spend much time seeing the historical
		 sites that Mexico had to offer. So for our next trip that we took this summer to Serbia, Greece and Poland, we spent our time exploring.

	  <h3> Serbia</h3>
		  
	  <blockquote>
		  		Since I have family in Serbia it wasn't difficult to find things to do or see. Also, my dad's brother gave me his car to travel with.
		  We spent out time travelling through central Serbia exploring some historical cites from the late 1700's, like 
		  <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Karadjordje">Karadjordje's</a> church or the Belgrade fortress. As well as natural wonders that 
		  the country had to offer like caves and hot springs.

	  <h3>Greece</h3>
		  
	  <blockquote>
		  		After we visited all the family we had in Serbia we booked a ticket to Greece since the flights were cheap (50 euros). We spent the first
		  two days in Athens, where we got to see Acropolis and the surrounding historical sites. From Athens we took a ferry to Mykonos and spent the
		  day at the world famous Paradise Beach. And the next day wandering around the island centre. The morning after we were on another ferry. This
		  time to Naxos. Unfortunately I had gotten food poisoning from the dinner we had in Mykonos and I spent the day in bed. The next morning we were
		  bound for Santorini on yet another ferry. Santorini had a lot of history and serene sights to offer. We visited a site believed to be the lost city
		  of Atlantis as well as an active volcano and swam in natural hot springs. We rode on donkeys which took us up from the port to Thera. And rented out 
		  an ATV to travel around the island to visit its capitol Fira as well as its white, black and red beaches.

	  <h3> Poland</h3>
		  
	  <blockquote>
		  		Poland happened to just be a layover for us so we had very little time to explore. We did manage to walk around Warsaw's old town that is built
		  	into an old fortress similar to Belgrade's fortress. I'm sure Poland had more to offer, but in the end we had enough traveling from our busy 
		  	summer seeing both Serbia and Greece.
